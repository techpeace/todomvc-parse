# TodoMVC for Parse

## Description

This is an implementation of the Backbone [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com) application that has been converted to make use of the [Parse JavaScript API](http://parse.com). Parse is a Backend-as-a-Service provider, so rather than using localStorage like the rest of the TodoVMC example applications, the data is stored on the Parse servers.

Since TodoMVC is a simple example application, there is no concept of users. All todos created will be visible to anyone that happens upon your installation.
